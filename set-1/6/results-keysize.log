Keysize Results
===============

Testing a variety of parameters gave the same result as the defaults. The number
of blocks seems to have a large impact on accuracy.

Command
-------

[ -f keysize ] && rm keysize; for i in {2,4,8,16}; do for j in {10,20,30,40}; do
make blocks=${i} max_key=${j} keysize && echo -en "\033[0;32m" && ./keysize
6.txt.decoded && echo -e "\033[0m"; rm keysize; done; done | grep "The best
found keysize was " | sort | sed 's/The best found keysize was /size: /' | uniq
-c | sort -nr &> results-keysize.log

Output (color stripped)
-----------------------

      5 size: 5.
      4 size: 2.
      3 size: 20.
      3 size: 15.
      1 size: 7.

Results
-------

Most likely keysize: a multiple of `5`.

Continue hacking with key sizes: `5`, `2`, `20`, `15`, and `7`.
